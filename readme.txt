Create image hotspots; highlight, show labels, links, images... options galore!

== Description ==
Interactive images for WordPress.

Swinging Hotspot lets you create active image areas that can "light-up" on hover or click, and/or show labels, links, or images in a pop-up. An interactive editor with "paint fill" capabilities makes it easy to specify the active areas in your image.

An interactive what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) "wizard" makes it easy to create hotspots and pop-up labels.
